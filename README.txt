This repo contains pretty much everything I can remember from my time at
Robotics @ Maryland, formatted nicely in LaTeX.

The motivation for this is that there were some projects that started and
finished, were not thoroughly explored, or considered and retired for various
reasons before any current members were around to observe and learn from
those experiences. There also may be some more obscure things that I would
never think to bring up unless they come up, which is something that I will
not be able to address after I graduate and leave the club. So hopefully
what I am able to remember as I write this will help at least a little bit
in the coming years (and maybe inspire future members in the club to do the
same if it is ever the case that a "generation" of R@M ends with one person
graduating).
